make a roulette game:
numbers from 0-36
player can
{
>choose an individual number
>choose a third: (1-12)(13-24)(25-36)
>choose a half:  first half(1-18)
			     second half(19-36)
>choose a color: red|black
red:			[(1,3,5,7,9,12,14,16,18,19,21,23,25,27,30,32,34,36)]
black:			[(2,4,6,8,10,11,13,15,17,20,22,24,26,28,29,31,33,35)]
>choose parity:  odd|even
>choose row:     [(3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36)]
				[(2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35)]
				[(1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34)]
}


left off at:
>need to check user key input

find a better way to impliment:
bool Roulette::checkIfUserIsCorrect() , i am trying to see if to generate a new random immeadetly 
if the user gets it right or if the programmer should call it manually
for now, i am implimenting it in the function (generateNewRandomNumber();)

bugs:
>tolower is not working [Roulette::setMUserInput(string userInput)]
>user input: 4,5,6,7,8,9 gives an error


How can i create this:
>turn all options into an enum (use enum)
>multithread
>>many games happening at once
>do i want a random number to be selected from 0-32 or from 0-n and MOD that large number by 32
>>possibly work on randomising numbers furthermore so it is not only time based
>use custom color library
>>make it do a rainbow when the user wins


good to haves:
>make statistics to keep track of how often each condition wins (how often does a number get picked or third, half,
color, etc)
>store system, the user can change the color of the font and such
>add a QUEUE showing the recent numbers that got called

research but not important:
>making the font larger in the console
>changing the font in console to fancier ones
>>can be an upgrade to get fancier fonts
>find a better way to initalize the red and black numbers
